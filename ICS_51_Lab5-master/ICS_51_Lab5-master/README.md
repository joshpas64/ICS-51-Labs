Visual Studio Files for Lab 5

Kena and Tung if you find this, just have upload or copy, paste, all the files besides debug into your project folder in visual studio. 

If you're not going to use visual studio, you will still need the files lab5.cpp, lab5testing.cpp, lodepng.cpp, lodepng.h, and all the images so you can do testing. Make sure they are all in the same directory. 

You really should just install visual studio because I dont know where else to find __masm, there might be a site you can test code online with. Also with this project it helps being able to set breakpoints, step into your assembly functions, and add watches for your variables.

Also I would suggest you comment out the third function in lab5.cpp it's still in progress and is extra credit in my class.
